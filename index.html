    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Kim holds an undergraduate degree from the University of Glasgow, BEng Aerospace Systems, where she graduated as the best in her class. She then joined the University of Strathclyde, where she completed a year of MRes training in offshore renewable energy. During her time there, she worked as a researcher with Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy. During her time in acadamia, she contributed to projects with Natural Power and RES. She is passionate about teaching STEM and has volunteered with the Engineering Development Trust Scotland, helping increase the exposure of young people to STEM. She has been nominated for Volunteer of the Year.
